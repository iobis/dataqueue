# dataqueue

The idea for this repo is to house issues that keep track of datasets that are "on deck" for integration into OBIS from across the OBIS nodes. It provides a clearinghouse for us to search and explore for connections to help find and develop partnerships in the data transformation process. It may also help to identify areas where multiple OBIS nodes could be working on similar data streams.

Here are a few basic guidelines that may help make the system more useful:

1) Use the title to describe the potentially inbound dataset in a meaningful way that may be immediately recognizable. This may well be the eventual title of the dataset as it would appear in OBIS.

2) The description of the issue here is more a short summary about the work that is needing to be done on the dataset and some useful details such as web links and contact information. The full "discussion" is meant to be carried on with comments on the issue over time from different sources who can fill in details and provide information on important connections between members of the OBIS network.

3) Use the assignee when possible to assign someone who is working on the dataset. This would be from the pool of GitHub users who have been invited to work in the dataqueue repo.

4) We will be working on a convention for labeling issues in the dataqueue. This might include tagging inbound datasets to OBIS nodes or some other useful identifiers. But we don't want to go overboard on trying to overthink labeling.

5) Once a dataset has made it through the process and is published via an OBIS node, close the issue to signify that work is done.
